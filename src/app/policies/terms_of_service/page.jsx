If the Services do not conform with the foregoing Performance Warranty, we will, at our expense, use reasonable efforts to promptly correct any such non-conformance. Such correction constitutes your sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of the Performance Warranty, provided that should we fail to cure such non-conformity, you shall be permitted to terminate the applicable Services in accordance with Section 10.2(a) (Termination) and receive a refund of any pre-paid Subscription Fees for such Services not delivered as of the date of termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Performance Warranty does not apply where you subscribe to a free version of the Services, an Evaluation or a paid version of the Services through the Open Source Projects, and we may suspend, limit or throttle such Services at any time where necessary due to the exigencies of our business.</p>
            <p className="mb-4"><strong>3.3 Disclaimers:</strong> You acknowledge and agree that: (a) the Performance Warranty does not apply to the extent of any non-conformance which is caused by use of the Services by you that is not in accordance with the Documentation; (b) the Services will evolve over time and that functionality may be added and removed from time to time in our sole discretion; and (c) your use of the Services may not be uninterrupted or error-free. We specifically do not represent or warrant that: (a) the Services will meet your requirements or will be fit for your particular purpose; (b) the Services will be able to achieve all intended outcomes or deliver all expected results; or (c) we will be able to provide solutions for all issues you may encounter.

Any operation or transaction completed via any third-party website, system, platform, or application is between you and the relevant third party, and is at your own risk. We cannot guarantee the continued availability of such features; accordingly, we may cease providing interoperability with them at any time, including if the relevant third-party ceases to make its application or service available for interoperation with the Services or changes the way it does so in a way that is not reasonably acceptable to us.</p>

            <p className="mb-4"><strong>6.1 Subscription Fees and Usage Verification:</strong> You agree to pay the Subscription Fees (if any) due for the duration of the Term. We verify our customers' use of the Services on a periodic basis to ensure compliance with the Subscription Allocation. In the event such verification reveals that your use of the Services exceeds the Subscription Allocation, you must reduce your usage of the Services to the amounts set out in the Subscription Allocation within 30 days of becoming aware of the overage, failing which, we (or our Channel Partner, where applicable) may invoice you for the associated additional Subscription Fees at our then current rates for the remainder of the then-current Term. If you purchase additional Subscription Allocations or move to a higher tier Service Plan during the Term, Subscription Fees shall be pro-rated for the remainder of the then-current Term. You may not downgrade your Subscription Allocation or move to a lower tier of any Service Plan during the term of this Agreement.</p>
            <p className="mb-4"><strong>6.2 Credits:</strong> If you purchase any Services under a credit model ("Credits"), those Credits form part of your Subscription Allocation. Credits may be applied for various Services. When Credits are applied, the number of Credits required to redeem a Service shall be deducted from your Credit balance. Unless otherwise stated on an applicable Order Form, all Credits must be used within the term of such Order Form, after which any unused Credits will expire and cannot be redeemed, refunded, or credited. Credits are not redeemable for cash and are non-transferable. Upon exhaustion of your Credits, you agree to engage in good faith negotiations with us to purchase additional credits and otherwise true-up your consumption within 30 days.</p>
            <p className="mb-4"><strong>6.3 Billing:</strong> Depending on whether you subscribe to the Services on an Order Form or Service Plan, the billing frequency and payment terms applicable to you shall be as follows: (a) Order Form: Where you subscribe to the Services on an Order Form, we will invoice you in accordance with the billing frequency and payment terms on the Order Form and you will pay each invoice per such terms. If billing frequency and payment terms are omitted from the Order Form, the default billing frequency is annual and the payment term is net 30 from the date of the invoice; or (b) Service Plan: Where you subscribe to the Services through a Service Plan, we and/or our third party payment processor will (and you hereby authorize us to) bill your payment card for the applicable Subscription Fee. You will be billed the applicable Subscription Fee in advance on or shortly after the date you select the Service Plan and on each month or anniversary thereafter, until this Agreement and/or the Services are terminated by you or us in accordance with this Agreement. We reserve the right to change the Subscription Fees applicable to our Service Plans at any time. If you do not agree to such change, you must delete your account and stop using the Services, at which point, this Agreement will be deemed to have been terminated by you at the end of your then current billing period. We will only charge you in respect of the period before termination based on the previously agreed Subscription Fee, and will not be required to refund any Subscription Fees to you. If you do agree to such change (which will be deemed from your continued use of the Services after the date the new Subscription Fee becomes effective), your next bill will include the new Subscription Fees on a pro rata basis.</p>
            <p className="mb-4"><strong>6.4 Late Payments:</strong> If we have not received timely payment of invoices or other amounts payable (including, where applicable, in the event of Credit over-consumption following the 30 day good faith negotiation period), we may notify you of the default and, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies, we may disable your access to all or part of the Services if payment has not been made by you or by the Channel Partner (as applicable) within 10 Business Days of the date of the notice of default.</p>
            <p className="mb-4"><strong>6.5 Committed Subscription Fees and Taxes:</strong> All Subscription Fees are: (a) non-cancellable and non-refundable; (b) payable in US Dollars; and (c) exclusive of any applicable taxes. You are required to pay and bear any sales, use, value-added, goods and services, withholding, or similar taxes or duties, whether domestic or foreign, related to the transactions under this Agreement, other than taxes based on our income. You will pay all amounts due under this Agreement in full without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding. If withholding is required under the laws of any relevant tax jurisdiction, withholding will be applied at the lowest applicable rate including the reduced rate of withholding under any tax treaty. You will also provide us with a copy of the withholding tax certificate or other applicable documentation as proof of payment.</p>
            <p><strong>6.6 Renewal Subscription Fee Increases:</strong> Unless otherwise set forth in the Service Plan or the Order Form (whichever is applicable), if your subscription to the Services auto-renews pursuant to Section 10.1 below, we may increase the Subscription Fees for each Renewal Term by no more than 10% over the prior year's Subscription Fees rate for the applicable Services.</p>

            <p className="mb-4"><strong>7.3 Confidentiality Obligations:</strong> Each Recipient will hold the Discloser's Confidential Information in confidence and, unless required by law and disclosed pursuant to Section 7.2, not make the Discloser's Confidential Information available to any third party or use the Discloser's Confidential Information for any purpose other than as set out in this Agreement. The foregoing will not apply with respect to any Confidential Information three (3) years after the termination or expiration of this Agreement (or, with respect to trade secrets, once such Confidential Information no longer constitutes a trade secret under applicable law).</p>
            <p><strong>7.4 Personnel Disclosure:</strong> Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, Recipient may disclose Discloser's Confidential Information, in whole or in part, to its employees, officers, directors, consultants and professional advisors who have a need to know and are legally bound to keep such Confidential Information confidential by confidentiality obligations, or, in the case of professional advisors, are bound by ethical duties, to keep such Confidential Information confidential consistent with the terms of this Agreement. Recipient is responsible and liable for its personnel's compliance with this Section 7, as if their actions or inactions were an action or inaction of Recipient.</p>

                </div>
                <p className="mt-2">Additionally, we reserve the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(a)(i) and/or to delete your data at our discretion without prior notice. Examples of when this might occur include prolonged account inactivity, violation of our terms, or system maintenance needs.</p>

                <p><strong>(b) Evaluations:</strong> This Agreement will, unless otherwise terminated early as provided herein, endure until the earlier of:</p>

                  <p><strong>(i)</strong> the expiry of the Evaluation Period; or</p>
                  <p><strong>(ii)</strong> the termination of this Agreement by us by providing 3 calendar days' notice to you, where we reasonably believe that the Services or Documentation are not being used in accordance with this Agreement, or are being accessed in a way that interferes with the normal operation of the Service.</p>

The Initial Term together with any Renewal Term(s) shall constitute the Term of the Order Form or Service Plan.</p>
                <p>For the avoidance of doubt, a valid notice of non-renewal provided by one party to the other in terms of this Section 10.1(c), will result in the termination of the Order Form or Service Plan (whichever is applicable) at the end of its then current Term, and no Subscription Fees shall be refunded to you.</p>

            <div className="space-y-2 mb-4">
              <p><strong>(a)</strong> the other party commits a material breach of any other term of this Agreement which breach is irremediable or, if such breach is remediable, the breaching party fails to remedy that breach within a period of 30 days after being notified in writing to do so;</p>

            <p className="mb-4"><strong>11.4 Severance:</strong> If any provision (or part of a provision) of this Agreement is found by any court or administrative body of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, the other provisions shall remain in force. If any invalid, unenforceable or illegal provision would be valid, enforceable, or legal if some part of it were deleted, the provision shall apply with whatever modification is necessary to give effect to the commercial intention of the parties.</p>
            <p className="mb-4"><strong>11.5 Waiver:</strong> No failure or delay by a party to exercise any right or remedy provided under this Agreement or by law shall constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor shall it prevent or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy. No single or partial exercise of such right or remedy shall prevent or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.</p>
            <p className="mb-4"><strong>11.6 Amendment:</strong> We may periodically update the terms of this Agreement. If you have an active account, we will notify you of updates via email or a notification through the Services. Unless the notice states otherwise, the updated terms of this Agreement will become effective and binding 30 calendar days after it is posted. In the event that you: (a) have subscribed to a paid version of the Services and reasonably object to any update to the terms of this Agreement, the parties may discuss in good faith with a view to achieving a commercially reasonable resolution. If no such resolution can be reached within 30 calendar days of our receipt of the objection, we will either not implement the update (or any part of the update which forms the subject of the objection) with respect to your use of the Services, or permit you to terminate this Agreement (and any applicable Order Form or Service Plan) without liability to either party; or (b) have subscribed to a free version of the Services and do not agree to any update to the terms of this Agreement, you must delete your account from the Services as described in Section 10.3(b) and immediately stop using the Services, at which point this Agreement will be deemed to have been terminated by you.

If you continue to use the Services after the update becomes effective, you acknowledge that you will be deemed to have agreed to (and will be bound by) the updated terms. No other amendment or modification of this Agreement, including by you or, where applicable, by any Channel Partner, shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized representative of each party.</p>
            <p className="mb-4"><strong>11.7 Entire Agreement:</strong> This Agreement, and any Order Forms, Service Plans, exhibits, schedules, attachments, and appendices referred to in it, constitute the whole agreement between the parties and supersede any previous arrangement, understanding or agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter they cover. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that in entering into this Agreement it does not rely on any undertaking, promise, assurance, statement, representation, warranty or understanding (whether in writing or not) of any person (whether party to this Agreement or not) relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, other than as expressly set out in this Agreement. No terms included in any purchase order or other ordering document, or any vendor invoicing service or similar platform or portal, maintained by or on your behalf shall be binding or have any effect.</p>
            <p className="mb-4"><strong>11.8 Conflict and Authority:</strong> If your subscription to the Services is purchased through a Channel Partner, the Channel Partner (and not we) is responsible for ensuring that the contents of any agreement between you and the Channel Partner, and the contents of any Order Form issued by the Channel Partner, are accurate and correct. In the event of a conflict between any provision in this Agreement and any provision in any agreement (or Order Form) between you and a Channel Partner, this Agreement will prevail to the extent of the conflict. The Channel Partner (if any) is not permitted to modify this Agreement, to make any warranties, representations, or undertakings on our behalf, or to bind us to any obligations other than those set forth in this Agreement. We will, however, have the right to enforce this Agreement and any Order Form directly against you.</p>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no consent is required for: (a) either party to assign this Agreement in its entirety to an Affiliate or to a successor of all or substantially all its assets through merger, reorganization, consolidation, or acquisition, provided that the assigning party provides notice of the assignment to the other party; or (b) a Channel Partner (if any) to assign your Order Form to us, in which event you will continue to be bound by this Agreement. No assignment shall relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations hereunder incurred prior to the assignment. Any attempted assignment, transfer, or other conveyance in violation of the foregoing shall be null and void. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.</p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">12. Data Processing Addendum (DPA)</h2>
            <p className="mb-4"><strong>12.1 Parties and Roles:</strong> This DPA is between Customer (the “Controller”) and Silence AI LLC (the “Processor”). Controller determines the purposes and means of processing Personal Data. Processor processes Personal Data only on Controller’s documented instructions and as set out in this DPA.</p>
            <p className="mb-4"><strong>12.2 Purpose and Scope:</strong> Processor will process Personal Data only as necessary to provide the Services ordered by Controller, specifically: Ingesting, storing, parsing, analyzing and visualizing web server logs that Controller’s systems supply to Processor (including logs collected via the Global Shield agent/proxy) for security, threat detection, and display in the Centralized Management Console (CMC); and Accessing, storing and processing email data (metadata, body, attachments) only where Controller has authorised such access via third-party APIs (for example Google/Gmail API, Microsoft/Outlook API) to provide Email Protector features and the secure webmail UI. Processor does not operate an SMTP service. Processor will not process Personal Data for any other purpose without Controller’s documented requests.</p>
            <p className="mb-4"><strong>12.3 Data Types & Subjects:</strong> Categories of Personal Data: IP addresses, request URIs, timestamps, HTTP headers, user-agent strings, country codes when present in logs, email metadata (sender, recipient, subject, timestamps), and email content/attachments only if Controller enables such access via authorized APIs. Data subjects: Visitors to Controller’s websites, Controller’s users and mailbox owners associated with Controller-authorized mailboxes.</p>
            <p className="mb-4"><strong>12.4 Data Minimization:</strong> Processor only collects the data provided by Controller via logs or authorised email APIs. Processor will not augment or collect additional personal data about end users except pursuant to Controller instructions.</p>
            <p className="mb-4"><strong>12.5 Subprocessors:</strong> Processor may engage subprocessors (cloud, storage, email-API providers and other service providers). Processor will enter written agreements with subprocessors imposing obligations consistent with this DPA. Controller may request a non-sensitive list of current subprocessors by contacting Processor; Processor may redact sensitive implementation details.</p>
            <p className="mb-4"><strong>12.6 Technical & Organizational Measures (TOMs):</strong> Processor implements industry-standard technical and organizational measures to operational and technical controls, including (as applicable): TLS for data-in-transit; encryption of stored data where feasible; role-based access control (RBAC) for internal accounts; multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative/privileged access; centralized secrets management; logging for security purposes; backups; vulnerability management; and an incident response process. Processor is only contractually committing to these technical/operational measures and is not obliged hereunder to obtain any particular external certification.</p>
            <p className="mb-4"><strong>12.7 Retention & Deletion:</strong> Processor will retain Personal Data only as necessary to provide Services or per Controller instruction. Default retention (modifiable by Controller): web server logs — 90 days; email data held for scanning/display — retained until Controller deletes the mailbox from the Service or as required by law. On termination, Controller may request deletion; Processor will delete or securely destroy Customer Personal Data within a commercially reasonable period, except where legal retention is required.</p>
            <p className="mb-4"><strong>12.8 International Transfers:</strong> Processor operates data centers worldwide. If Personal Data is transferred across borders, Processor will rely on legally permitted transfer mechanisms and appropriate safeguards required by applicable law. Processor uses TLS encryption in all transfer mechanisms and operations. Controller remains responsible for any local authorisations or restrictions required for transfers initiated by Controller.</p>
            <p className="mb-4"><strong>12.9 Data Subject Requests:</strong> Processor will, to the extent permitted by law and insofar as such requests relate to processing performed on Controller’s behalf, provide reasonable assistance to Controller to enable Controller to respond to data-subject requests (access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, objection). Controller remains primarily responsible for receiving and responding to data-subject requests.</p>
            <p className="mb-4"><strong>12.10 Security Incidents & Notification:</strong> If Processor becomes aware of a confirmed Personal Data breach affecting Controller Personal Data, Processor will notify Controller without undue delay (and in accordance with applicable law) and will provide available technical details and reasonable operational assistance to enable Controller to assess and comply with its obligations. Processor’s assistance is technical/operational only; Processor does not assume Controller’s legal notification obligations.</p>
            <p className="mb-4"><strong>12.11 No Audit / Certification / Source Code Obligation:</strong> Controller acknowledges that: Processor will not be contractually required to obtain or maintain any specific external certification (for example, SOC/ISO) under this DPA; Processor will not provide on-site inspections, white-box access, source-code disclosure, internal credentials, raw internal logs, or developer-level access to Controller or to any third party as part of compliance verification; and Processor makes available a non-sensitive summary description of its technical and organizational measures publicly at https://silenceai.net/instructions and https://ai-soc1.silenceai.net/instructions. Processor will not disclose privileged operational artifacts.</p>
            <p className="mb-4"><strong>12.12 Liability & Order of Precedence:</strong> The Parties’ liability for data protection matters is governed by the Agreement. To the extent of any conflict between this DPA and the Agreement, this DPA governs with respect to data processing matters. Nothing in this DPA expands Processor obligations beyond the Agreement.</p>
